# Social-Network

## Description
This Python project simulates social media interactions through graphs representing follow, like, and comment relationships among users. It utilizes the 'Graph' class from the 'graph' module to manage relationships. The program generates random user names and establishes random follow, like, and comment connections between them. Key functionalities include calculating engagement rates, determining influence between users, finding shortest paths for interactions, and identifying the highest engagement path. The main menu offers options to display various relationship metrics, shortest paths, engagement paths, and exit the program.
